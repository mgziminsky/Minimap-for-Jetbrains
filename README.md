MiniMap (A CodeGlance Fork)
==========

## This is an unofficial fork of the excellent CodeGlance plugin, which unfortunately no longer seems to be maintained.

#### Main differences compared to CodeGlance
- Works correctly with virtual space enabled
- Minimap can be used as a scrollbar

-------------

Latest build: https://github.com/mgziminsky/Minimap-for-Jetbrains/releases

Jetbrains IDE plugin that displays a zoomed out overview, or minimap, similar to the one found in Sublime into the editor pane. The minimap allows for quick scrolling letting you jump straight to sections of code.

 - Works with both light and dark themes using your customized colors for syntax highlighting.
 - Color rendering using IntelliJ's tokenizer
 - Scrollable!
 - Embedded into editor window
